Some new and exciting things on the horizon for me (more on that later) which means I’ll be leaving YoungCapital. So the amazing and caring team that I’m sad to be leaving is hiring! Check out the post here: ✨ https://www.youngcapital.nl/vacatures/549085-fulltime-javascript-developer-at-youngcapital-in-hoofddorp ✨

Even if something doesn’t sound exactly like you, if you like the sound of the work please apply! It’s been an absolute joy to be a part of this team. ❤️
