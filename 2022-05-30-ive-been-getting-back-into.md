Iâ€™ve been getting back into playing bass again. Pretty happy with this little home setup I put together.

Iâ€™m particularly chuffed with the white/red ashdown AAA 60W amp I found. Itâ€™s nice to have an amp that isnâ€™t just a big black box if youâ€™re going to keep it in the living room. 

The bass is a Sqiuer Classic Vibe 60s P-Bass. Iâ€™ve always liked the P-Bass sound and look. (Thanks for the squier p-bass videos @TylerSpicerMusi@twitter.com !)

Now I just need to find some people to play with. ðŸ˜› Anyone in the area fancy jamming some time?
