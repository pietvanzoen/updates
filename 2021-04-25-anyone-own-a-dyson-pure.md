Anyone own a Dyson Pure Cool and found a good 3rd party replacement filter? @Dyson@twitter.com has been out of stock of theirs for months with no idea of when theyâ€™ll come back in stock. 

Pretty frustrating to folk out for a high quality air filter only for it to become obsolete within a year because replacement filters are not available.
