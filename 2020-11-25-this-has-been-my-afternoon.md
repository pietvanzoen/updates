@pietvanzoen@twitter.com This has been my afternoon: ![](/media/yells-at-cloud.jpg)

Basically even if you're transferring to an external device the file is cached with the Files app. And when the storage is full you can't move anything off the iPad, even to an external device. The only way to purge the cache is to delete/reinstall the Files app. ðŸ˜±
