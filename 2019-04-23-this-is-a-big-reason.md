This is a big reason why I still use lodash or Ramda in a number of my projects. Clever code is rarely readable code. It feels good when you write it, but in a team working on production code readability is your no. 1 priority. Javascript syntax has come a long way, but sometimes a utility library is still useful to abstract common patterns that would be verbose or unreadable with today's js syntax. https://gomakethings.com/clever-javascript-does-not-mean-simple-or-readable/
