I’ve always struggled to make time to read work related books. But I’m feeling the need to challenge myself. 

I have The Manager’s Path (@skamille), Resilient Management (@lara_hogan) and An Elegant Puzzle (@Lethain) on my bookshelf. Which should I start with and what are you tips for making time for this kind of reading?
