Just started using #ChatGPT and #GithubCopilot for a personal project and I'm pretty impressed. They've been super helpful with writing tests and figuring out complex #SQL queries and #Regex.

Also, I accidentally discovered that Copilot can help write commit messages. Using a commit message template with a prompt comment and running git commit --verbose, Copilot does a great job of reading the diff and figuring out the appropriate commit message.
