One of the hardest things I've found going from a developer role to a #mentoring role is going from delivering solutions to helping others find their solution to their problem. The developer role is about taking a problem and returning a solution. Doing the same in mentoring (giving solutions to problems) hasn't been a great way of helping people grow.
