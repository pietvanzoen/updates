If you react immediately and negatively to someone’s request for you to stop doing something that offends/upsets them, I encourage you to think more slowly. Your gut reaction, your fast efficient thinking, is built up of *your* experiences and perceptions. 

Think more slowly about your reactions and take a moment to think of the experiences of the person requesting change. 

Don’t let yourself only be defined by the experiences and perception you have until now. Grow!
