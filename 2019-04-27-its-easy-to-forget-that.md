It’s easy to forget that part of learning to code is learning how to even get a program running, which is often more confusing/frustrating than the code.

I feel that environment knowledge is often discounted over programming knowledge. Using the command line, knowing how to install a program, knowing how to install dependencies, dealing with version control, and knowing how to debug all of the above, all of this is vital knowledge that’s hard to learn. 

So yeah. If you’re learning to code and find this hard, well, it is! Be kind to yourself. Environments are unintuitive and fickle. We’ve all battled through this stuff and still do.
